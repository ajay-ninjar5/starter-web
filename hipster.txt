ʻOumuamua is a small object, estimated to be between 100 and 1,000 meters long, with its width and thickness both estimated to range between 35 and 167 meters (328–3,280 ft × 115–548 ft × 115–548 ft).[11] It has a dark red color, similar to objects in the outer Solar System. ʻOumuamua showed no signs of a comet coma (atmosphere) despite its close approach to the Sun, but underwent non-gravitational acceleration.[21][22] This effect is seen in many icy comets,[22][23] although other reasons have been suggested.[24][25][26] Nonetheless, the object could be a remnant of a disintegrated rogue comet (or exocomet), according to a NASA scientist.[27][28] The object has a rotation rate similar to the average spin rate seen in Solar System asteroids, but is more elongated than all but a few other natural bodies. While a strengthless object (rubble pile) would require it to be of a density similar to rocky asteroids,[29] a small amount of internal strength similar to icy comets[30] would allow a relatively low density. ʻOumuamua is tumbling, rather than smoothly rotating, and is moving so fast relative to the Sun that there is no chance it originated in the Solar System. It also means that ʻOumuamua cannot be captured into a solar orbit, so it will eventually leave the Solar System and resume traveling through interstellar space. It will take the object roughly 20,000 years to travel the Solar System before exiting.[Note 3] ʻOumuamua's planetary system of origin and the amount of time it has spent traveling amongst the stars are unknown.
